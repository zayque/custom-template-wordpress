# custom-template-wordpress
interview question

This plugin includes additional comments in the header that provide information about how to use the plugin and what it does. 
It also includes a check to see if the template file "custom-template.php" already exists in the current theme's directory. 
If it does not exist, the plugin creates the file and writes the necessary information to it. 
Then it creates the new page and assigns the custom-template.php as the template file.
This way the plugin creates the template file programmatically and assigns it to the new page.
